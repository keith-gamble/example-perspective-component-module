# Example Component Library for Ignition Perspective

Welcome to the Example Component Library documentation! This guide demonstrates how to create custom components for Ignition Perspective, Inductive Automation's web-based application platform.

## What's Inside

This project provides:

- ✨ Working example components with full source code
- 📚 Comprehensive development guides
- 🏗️ Production-ready project structure
- 🔧 Development workflow best practices
- 🚀 CI/CD pipeline setup
- 🐳 Docker-based development environment

## Project Structure

The repository follows standard Ignition module conventions:

```
example-perspective-component-module/
├── common/          # Shared code for Gateway and Designer
├── designer/        # Designer-specific code
├── gateway/         # Gateway-specific code
├── web/             # Frontend React components
└── docker/          # Development environment
```

:::info Why This Structure?
This structure separates concerns while maintaining Ignition's module conventions. Each directory serves a specific purpose in the module's lifecycle, from development to deployment.
:::

## Key Features
